# Generative AI Text Model

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly Generative AI model that generates new text based on a given prompt.
It is built using Python, TensorFlow, and deep learning techniques.

## Objective
To demonstrate how a simple text-based generative AI model works and to understand the fundamentals of sequence modeling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy

## How It Works
1. Input text is tokenized.
2. Sequences are created for training.
3. A neural network model is trained.
4. The model generates new text based on user input.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries.
2. Run the training script.
3. Use the generate script to produce text.
